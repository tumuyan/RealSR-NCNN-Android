# RealSR-NCNN-Android

[中文说明](https://github.com/tumuyan/RealSR-NCNN-Android/blob/master/README_CHS.md)  

RealSR-NCNN-Android is a simple Android application that based on [Waifu2x-NCNN](https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan), [SRMD-NCNN](https://github.com/nihui/srmd-ncnn-vulkan), [RealCUGAN-NCNN](https://github.com/nihui/realcugan-ncnn-vulkan), [RealSR-NCNN](https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan), & [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN).  
The application does not collect any private information from your device.  
Download: Github [Release](https://github.com/tumuyan/RealSR-NCNN-Android/releases) or [CoolApk](https://www.coolapk.com/apk/292197)

This repository contains 7 project:  
1. RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI can build a APK (has a GUI and easy to use). Actually it is a shell of the follow programs.
2. RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI can build a program that can be used by the console (for example, Termux) for Android. This program can use realsr models and real-esrgan models.
3. RealCUGAN-NCNN-Android-CLI  can build a program that can be used by the console (for example, Termux) for Android.
4. SRMD-NCNN-Android-CLI can build a program that can be used by the console (for example, Termux) for Android.
5. Waifu2x-NCNN-Android-CLI can build a program that can be used by the console (for example, Termux) for Android (models not packaged in APK).
6. Resize-NCNN-Android-CLI can build a program that can be used by the console (for example, Termux) for Android. use ncnn only to reduce the elf file size. Contains classical interpolation mode `nearest` `bilinear` `bicubic` and `avir` `lancir`
7. Resize-CLI just a demo like the Resize-NCNN-Android-CLI, but it not need ncnn and could build by VS

### How to use RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI
Two ways of selecting files:
1. Share one or more images from other apps (e.g. Gallery) to this app
2. In this app, click `Select Image` to select an image

Tow ways of running:
1. chose a model, click the `Run` button and wait some time. The photo view will show the result when the progrem finish its work. If you like the result, you could click the `Save` button.  
2. input shell command and enter. (You can input `help` and get more info)

### Add more models to RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI
RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI could load extra models from sdcard automatily in ver 1.7.6. You could download more models from https://huggingface.co/tumuyan/realsr .
1. Make a directory in sdcard.
2. Input the directory path to `Path for custom models (RealSR/ESRGAN/Waifu2x)` and save.
3. Download and copy models to the directory you make.
5. Return the main activity, then you could select the new models.

### Convert pth models by yourself
Also you could convert ESRGAN pth moddls by yourself.
1. Download ESRGAN pytorch models from [https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database) and unzip it to somewhere.
2. Download [cupscale](https://github.com/n00mkrad/cupscale) and unzip it in your PC.
3. Convert pytorch models to ncnn. Open CupscaleData\bin\pth2ncnn, use pth2ncnn.exe to convert pth files to ncnn file.
3. Rename models, just like this:
```
models-Real-ESRGAN-AnimeSharp  // directory should have a suffix of models-Real- or models-ESRGAN-
├─x4.bin                       // models name as x[n], n is scale
├─x4.param
```
* This tool can only convert ESRGAN models, not Real-ESRGAN models. If there are Real-ESRGAN models with perfect effect that need to be converted, I can help you convert them manually.

### Web UI
https://huggingface.co/spaces/tumuyan/RealSR
The hugging face repository contains the model and executable file for Windows/Linux platform, you can clone the repository and open a web UI in the python (instead of the original command line program)
Also you could try online demo! [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tumuyan/realsr-docker)


### About Real-ESRGAN

**Note that RealESRGAN may still fail in some cases as the real-world degradations are really too complex.**

## About Real-CUGAN
[[project]](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN)  
Real-CUGAN is an AI super resolution model for anime images, trained in a million scale anime dataset, using the same architecture as Waifu2x-CUNet. 

## How to build RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI
### step1
https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/releases  
download ncnn-yyyymmdd-android-vulkan-shared.zip.  
https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp
download the source of libwebp.  

### step2
extract `ncnn-yyyymmdd-android-vulkan-shared.zip` into `../3rdparty/ncnn-android-vulkan-shared`  
extract the source of libwebp into `../3rdparty/libwebp`

```
RealSR-NCNN-Android\RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI\app\src\main\assets\
├─3rdparty
│   ├─libwebp
│   └─ncnn-android-vulkan-shared
│       └─arm64-v8a
├─RealCUGAN-NCNN-Android-CLI  
├─SRMD-NCNN-Android-CLI
├─Waifu2x-NCNN-Android-CLI 
├─Resize-NCNN-Android-CLI  
└─RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI
```

### step3
open this project with Android Studio, rebuild it and then you could find the program in `RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI\app\build\intermediates\cmake\release\obj\arm64-v8a`


## How to use RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI
### Download models

You could run this command in shell (termux) to download and unzip program and models:
`curl https://huggingface.co/spaces/tumuyan/RealSR/raw/main/install_realsr_android.sh | bash`

or download and unzip them by your self.
`https://huggingface.co/spaces/tumuyan/RealSR/resolve/main/assets.zip`


### Example Command

make sure the elf file has execute permission. Then input command

```shell
./realsr-ncnn -i input.jpg -o output.jpg
```

### Full Usages
```console
Usage: realsr-ncnn -i infile -o outfile [options]...

  -h                   show this help
  -v                   verbose output
  -i input-path        input image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory
  -o output-path       output image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory
  -s scale             upscale ratio (4, default=4)
  -t tile-size         tile size (>=32/0=auto, default=0) can be 0,0,0 for multi-gpu
  -m model-path        realsr model path (default=models-DF2K_JPEG)
  -g gpu-id            gpu device to use (default=0) can be 0,1,2 for multi-gpu, -1 use cpu
  -j load:proc:save    thread count for load/proc/save (default=1:2:2) can be 1:2,2,2:2 for multi-gpu
  -x                   enable tta mode
  -f format            output image format (jpg/png/webp, default=ext/png)
```

- `input-path` and `output-path` accept either file path or directory path
- `scale` = scale level, 4 = upscale 4x
- `tile-size` = tile size, use smaller value to reduce GPU memory usage, default selects automatically
- `load:proc:save` = thread count for the three stages (image decoding + realsr upscaling + image encoding), using larger values may increase GPU usage and consume more GPU memory. You can tune this configuration with "4:4:4" for many small-size images, and "2:2:2" for large-size images. The default setting usually works fine for most situations. If you find that your GPU is hungry, try increasing thread count to achieve faster processing.
- `format` = the format of the image to be output, png is better supported, however webp generally yields smaller file sizes, both are losslessly encoded

If you encounter crash or error, try to upgrade your derive

## How to build RealSR-NCNN-Android-GUI
download [models & elf files](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tumuyan/RealSR/resolve/main/assets.zip), unzip and put them to this folder, then build it with Android Studio.
