# NCNN-Modules
## How to build RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI
### step1
https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/releases  
download ncnn-yyyymmdd-android-vulkan-shared.zip.  
https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp
download the source of libwebp.  
https://opencv.org/releases/
download opencv-android-sdk.

### step2
extract `ncnn-yyyymmdd-android-vulkan-shared.zip` into `../3rdparty/ncnn-android-vulkan-shared`  
extract the source of libwebp into `../3rdparty/libwebp`  
extract `opencv-version-android-sdk` into `../3rdparty/opencv-android-sdk`
```

```

### step3
Open this project with Android Studio, rebuild it and the build result in `RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI\*\build\intermediates\cmake\release\obj\arm64-v8a` or `RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI\*\build\intermediates\cmake\debug\obj\arm64-v8a` could copy to the GUI project automatilly.    
Click `3rdparty/copy_cli_build_result.bat` and it could copy the other files to GUI project.


## How to use RealSR-NCNN-Android-CLI
### Download models
You could download `assets.zip` from github release page and unzip it to get models, or download models from https://github.com/tumuyan/realsr-models .

### Example Command
Make sure the elf file has execute permission. Then input command

```shell
./realsr-ncnn -i input.jpg -o output.jpg
```

### Full Usages
The usage of others program is same as realsr-ncnn.
```console
Usage: realsr-ncnn -i infile -o outfile [options]...

  -h                   show this help
  -v                   verbose output
  -i input-path        input image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory
  -o output-path       output image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory
  -s scale             upscale ratio (4, default=4)
  -t tile-size         tile size (>=32/0=auto, default=0) can be 0,0,0 for multi-gpu
  -m model-path        realsr model path (default=models-DF2K_JPEG)
  -g gpu-id            gpu device to use (default=0) can be 0,1,2 for multi-gpu, -1 use cpu
  -j load:proc:save    thread count for load/proc/save (default=1:2:2) can be 1:2,2,2:2 for multi-gpu
  -x                   enable tta mode
  -f format            output image format (jpg/png/webp, default=ext/png)
```

- `input-path` and `output-path` accept either file path or directory path
- `scale` = scale level, 4 = upscale 4x
- `tile-size` = tile size, use smaller value to reduce GPU memory usage, default selects automatically
- `load:proc:save` = thread count for the three stages (image decoding + realsr upscaling + image encoding), using larger values may increase GPU usage and consume more GPU memory. You can tune this configuration with "4:4:4" for many small-size images, and "2:2:2" for large-size images. The default setting usually works fine for most situations. If you find that your GPU is hungry, try increasing thread count to achieve faster processing.
- `format` = the format of the image to be output, png is better supported, however webp generally yields smaller file sizes, both are losslessly encoded

If you encounter crash or error, try to upgrade your derive



# MNN-SR
This module is a [mnn](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN) implementation for super resolution. MNN could support more models than ncnn.  
I am trying to make this module a CLI program that can be compiled in both VS(for Windows) and AS(for Android), 
but it has some problem in VS. **🙏Waiting your help!**

### How to build in Android Studio
1. download opencv lib and others libs and extract them to RealSR-NCNN-Android/3rdparty just like the ncnn modules.
2. download mnn lib and extract them to RealSR-NCNN-Android/3rdparty
```
├─libwebp
├─mnn_android
│  ├─arm64-v8a
│  ├─armeabi-v7a
│  └─include

```
3. sync and build this module
4. copy models and *.so from mnn_android  to assets dir and build the GUI App.
5. run mnnsr commands in App

### Usages
The usage of others program is same as realsr-ncnn. Add these param:  
```console
  -b backend           forward backend type(CPU=0,AUTO=4,CUDA=2,OPENCL=3,OPENGL=6,VULKAN=7,NN=5,USER_0=8,USER_1=9, default=3)
  -c color-type        model & output color space type (RGB=1, BGR=2, YCbCr=5, YUV=6, GRAY=10, GRAY model & YCbCr output=11, GRAY model & YUV output=12, default=1)
  -d decensor-mode     remove censor mode (Not=-1, Mosaic=0, default=-1)
  
```
